### Project: Simple Recipe Management System
### Project Overview:
This project allows users to view, add, edit, and delete recipes. Each team member will be responsible for creating one page that corresponds to a particular feature of the application. The goal is to create a simple recipe management application.

## Assigning Pages
### Aashlesh – Home Page and Recipe List Page
Description: Aashlesh will create the Recipe List page, where all the available recipes will be displayed.

* Show a list of recipes with their names, a short description, and a thumbnail image.
* Provide options to view the recipe details or delete it.
* Add a search bar to filter recipes by name or category (e.g., desserts, appetizers).
### Thasrifha – Add Recipe Page
Description: Thasrifha will focus on the Add Recipe page, where users can submit their own recipes.

* Design a form to collect the following information:
Recipe Name
Ingredients
Instructions
Recipe Category (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner)
Recipe Image (optional)
* Implement form validation to ensure all required fields are filled in.

### Bhoomika – Edit Recipe Page
Description: Bhoomika will work on the Edit Recipe page, allowing users to modify an existing recipe.

* Pre-fill the form with the current recipe details (name, ingredients, instructions).
* Allow the user to edit any part of the recipe.
* Include a Save button to update the recipe and a Cancel button to return to the Recipe List page.

### Aashlesh – Delete Recipe Confirmation and Recipe Detail Page
#### Delete Recipe Confirmation
Description: Aashlesh will create the Delete Recipe confirmation functionality.
* Implement a Delete button on the Recipe List page next to each recipe.
* Add a confirmation dialog that asks, "Are you sure you want to delete this recipe?" before deleting the recipe.
* Ensure that the recipe is removed from the list after confirmation.
#### Recipe Detail Page
Description: Aashlesh will work on the Recipe Detail page, which shows more information about a specific recipe when clicked from the list.
*  Display full details of the recipe, including the name, ingredients, instructions, and image (if provided).
* Add an Edit button that directs users to the Edit Recipe page.
* Include a Back button to return to the Recipe List page.
